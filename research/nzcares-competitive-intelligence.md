## Critical Gaps to Exploit

### 1. Zero Social Proof
- No verified reviews on G2, Capterra, or TrustPilot
- Only internal testimonials on their website
- **Attack Vector**: Highlight your verified customer reviews prominently

### 2. ABDM/NDHM Uncertainty
- No explicit confirmation of Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission integration
- Competitors (MocDoc, KareXpert) explicitly advertise ABDM readiness
- **Attack Vector**: If you have ABDM integration, make it a key differentiator

### 3. Bootstrapped Limitations
- Cannot match marketing/sales investment of funded competitors
- Limited customer success resources
- **Attack Vector**: Emphasize your funding, longevity, customer support investment

### 4. Generic Parent Company
- NextZen Minds is a generalist software company
- Healthcare is one of many verticals
- **Attack Vector**: Position as healthcare-only focus, domain expertise

### 5. Content Marketing Heavy, Conversion Light
- Extensive blog content (SEO play) but thin on case studies
- No public client logos or implementation stories
- **Attack Vector**: Showcase real customer implementations, ROI data

### 6. Mobile App Ambiguity
- Patient/doctor mobile apps mentioned but not found in app stores
- Competitors have established app presence
- **Attack Vector**: If you have rated apps in stores, highlight reviews

### 7. Implementation Promises vs. Reality
- Claims "go-live in days" but no third-party verification
- Complex HMS implementations typically face challenges
- **Attack Vector**: Provide realistic timelines, reference customers

### 8. Small Team Stretched Thin
- 50-200 employees supporting multiple NextZen products
- Customer support quality at scale is questionable
- **Attack Vector**: Emphasize dedicated healthcare support team size

### 9. No Regional Language Evidence
- Claims to support Indian regional languages but no proof
- Critical for Tier 2/3 city adoption
- **Attack Vector**: Demonstrate actual vernacular support

### 10. Pricing Opacity
- Must request quotes for all pricing
- No transparent starter pricing
- **Attack Vector**: Offer transparent, published pricing tiers
